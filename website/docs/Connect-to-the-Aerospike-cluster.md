title: Connect To The Aerospike Cluster
description: Connect To The Aerospike Cluster
---

You can connect to an Aerospike cluster deployed by Aerospike Kubernetes Operator through asadm or through applications that use Aerospike client libraries. 

## Port access
When the Aerospike cluster is deployed in a single pod per Kubernetes host mode, ports `3000 (service port)` and `4333 (TLS port)` on all Kubernetes hosts should be accessible to all client and tools.

When the Aerospike cluster is configured to have multiple pods per Kubernetes host mode, port-range `(30000â€“32767)` on all Kubernetes hosts should be accessible to all client and tools.

Configure the firewall rules for the Kubernetes cluster accordingly.

Also see [Cluster-configuration-settings](Cluster-configuration-settings.md) file for the use of `multiPodPerHost` setting.

## Obtain the Aerospike node endpoints

Run the kubectl describe command to get the IP addresses and port numbers:

 kubectl -n <Kubernetes_namespace> describe aerospikecluster <Aerospike_cluster>


The **Status > Pods*** section provides pod-wise access, alternate access, TLS access, and TLS alternate access endpoints as well as TLS name (if TLS is configured) to be used to access the cluster.

```sh
$ kubectl -n aerospike describe aerospikecluster aerocluster

```

## Connecting to the cluster
When connecting from outside the Kubernetes cluster network, you need to use the host external IPs. By default, the Operator configures access endpoints to use Kubernetes host internal IPs and alternate access endpoints to use host external IPs.

Please refer to [network policy](Cluster-configuration-settings.md#network-policy) configuration for details.

From the example status output, for pod aerocluster-0-0, the alternate access endpoint is 34.70.193.192:31312

### With client
To use a client from outside the Kubernetes network using external IPs set the following for the client policy using appropriate client API.
```yaml
host: 34.70.193.192
port: :31312
username: admin
password: admin123 # based on the configured secret
use-services-alternate: true
```

To use asadm from within the Kubernetes network run
```yaml
host: 10.128.15.225
port: :31312
username: admin
password: admin123 # based on the configured secret
use-services-alternate: false
```

### With asadm
With kubectl
```sh
# kubectl run -it --rm --restart=Never aerospike-tool -n aerospike --image=aerospike/aerospike-tools:latest -- asadm -h <cluster-name> -U <user> -P <password>
kubectl run -it --rm --restart=Never aerospike-tool -n aerospike --image=aerospike/aerospike-tools:latest -- asadm -h aeroclustersrc -U admin -P admin123
```

To use asadm from outside the Kubernetes network:
```sh
$ asadm -h 34.70.193.192:31312 -U admin -P admin123 --services-alternate
```

To use asadm from within the Kubernetes network:
```sh
$ asadm -h 10.128.15.225:31312 -U admin -P admin123
```
